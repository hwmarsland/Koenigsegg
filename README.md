# Koenigsegg's Ultimate Power On Demand System (UPOD)
Koenigsegg's custom Light Speed Transmission is uniquely impressive, allowing the driver to make lightning fast shifts between any gears, not just adjacent ones. To allow this, it employs a technology called UPOD or Ultimate Power On Demand that acts as "the brain that instantly selects and engages optimum gearing for maximum acceleration" ([Koenigsegg](https://www.koenigsegg.com/lst)). I have recreated the UPOD system here.
